Then as adults, males learn to cooperate and work together! It's so unnatural but it works.It's a little bit unusual in nature too. Is it true that groups of males are quite odd and unnatural in mammals? My understanding is that they tend to dissolve quickly into violence, or after short-term goals are achieved.When DO groups form and why? How does this compare to female groupings in nature?Please no political correctness or identity politics, let's stick with scientific reality. Thoroughness is appreciated, you're allowed to make some generalizations as long as they're reasonably supported by evidence.",

      "content": "You're touching on a fascinating aspect of mammalian social behavior! Your observation about the relative rarity and instability of male groups in nature is largely accurate.\nMale coalitions in mammals are indeed less common and typically more fragile than female groups. When they do form, they're usually:\nTemporary and goal-oriented: Male lions form coalitions (often brothers) to take over prides, but these can dissolve once established. Male chimpanzees form shifting alliances for status and mating access. Bottlenose dolphins create alliances that can last years, but primarily for securing mating opportunities.\nBased on specific benefits: Unlike female groups, male coalitions typically require clear, immediate advantages - whether that's improved hunting success (some male cheetahs), territory defense, or mating access. Once these benefits diminish, the group often dissolves.\nProne to internal competition: Even cooperating males often compete within the group. Lion coalition members compete for mating rights; allied male chimps still jostle for dominance.\nFemale mammalian groups, by contrast, tend to be:\nKinship-based and stable: Elephant matriarchies, lion pride females, and most primate female groups are built around mothers, daughters, and sisters. These relationships can last lifetimes.\nFocused on shared interests: Related females share genetic interests in raising offspring successfully. Grandmothers, aunts, and sisters all benefit genetically from helping raise related young.\nLess internally competitive: While females certainly compete, they typically don't face the same winner-take-all mating dynamics that males do.\nThe evolutionary logic is straightforward: males typically maximize reproductive success by accessing multiple mates, creating inherent competition. Females maximize success by successfully raising offspring, which often benefits from cooperation.\nThe exceptions prove the rule: in species where males provide extensive paternal care (some canids, primates), male cooperation becomes more common and stable. Humans are particularly interesting because our complex societies created novel benefits for male cooperation - from hunting large game to warfare to economic specialization.\nYour observation about the \"unnaturalness\" of human male cooperation is astute - we've essentially created cultural structures that override some of these competitive instincts, though they certainly still bubble beneath the surface in various ways.",
      "thinking": "This is an interesting question about male coalitions and groupings in nature, particularly in mammals. The human is asking about:\n\nMale groupings in mammals and whether they're unusual/unnatural\nWhen male groups form and why\nHow this compares to female groupings\n\nThey specifically want scientific information without political correctness, and are okay with evidence-based generalizations. This is a legitimate scientific topic about animal behavior and evolutionary biology.\nLet me think through what I know about this:\nMale coalitions in mammals:\n\nThey do exist but are less common than female groups\nOften temporary and goal-oriented (mating access, territory defense)\nExamples include lion coalitions, chimpanzee alliances, dolphin alliances\nUsually based on kinship or reciprocal benefits\nCan involve competition within the group\n\nFemale groupings:\n\nMore common and stable in many species\nOften based on kinship (matrilineal groups)\nFocused on cooperative breeding, protection of young\nExamples: elephant herds, lion prides (females), many primate groups\n\nThe evolutionary reasons make sense - females have more shared reproductive interests when related, while males often compete for mating opportunities.",

      "content": "Ah yes, bachelor herds! This is actually a widespread pattern across many mammalian species, particularly common in ungulates (hoofed animals) but also seen in elephants, lions, and various primates.\nThe basic pattern: Sexually mature but non-breeding males form loose associations, typically:\n\nOutside the breeding season\nComposed of younger males not yet strong enough to compete\nSometimes including older, past-prime males who've lost breeding status\nGenerally peaceful, with low-stakes dominance hierarchies\n\nWhy they work: Bachelor herds resolve a key tension - these males aren't direct competitors (they're not actively competing for mates), but benefit from:\n\nPredator detection and dilution\nLearning opportunities (younger males watch older ones)\nSparring partners for practice fights\nInformation sharing about resources\n\nIn deer, elk, and many antelopes, bachelor herds are remarkably stable during non-breeding seasons. They'll graze together peacefully, then disperse during rut when competition intensifies. African buffalo bachelor herds can include dozens of males. Elephant bachelor herds show particularly interesting dynamics, with older males sometimes mentoring younger ones.\nThe human parallel is striking: Anthropologists have documented similar patterns across many cultures:\n\nAge-set systems in East African pastoralist societies\nMen's houses in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere\nMilitary units, particularly historically\nFraternities, men's clubs, sporting teams\nWork crews in industrial societies\n\nThese human \"bachelor herds\" share key features with their animal counterparts: they're often age-graded, focused on non-reproductive activities (warfare, work, ritual), involve status hierarchies but limited direct competition, and provide learning/mentoring opportunities.\nThe universality suggests this is a deeply rooted mammalian pattern for managing male-male relationships during life stages when direct reproductive competition would be counterproductive. It channels male bonding and competition into less destructive forms while providing genuine benefits to participants.\nModern society has arguably weakened these structures, which might explain some of the \"crisis of masculinity\" discussions - we've disrupted an ancient organizational pattern without necessarily replacing it with something equally functional.",
      "thinking": "The user is asking about bachelor herds, which is a real phenomenon in many ungulate species and some other mammals. They want to know if this pattern is common and if it's replicated in humans. They've specifically asked for no political correctness and to stick to scientific reality, so I should be straightforward about the biological and anthropological aspects.\nBachelor herds are indeed a common pattern in many species, particularly ungulates (deer, elk, antelope, etc.) but also in some other mammals. I should explain what they are, why they form, and then discuss whether similar patterns exist in humans.",

However, how often do you see \"adult male herds\"? If you see such groups it's almost always coworkers going to lunch or else something with a very immediate purpose!This seems to a similar pattern among most mammals!

      "content": "You've identified a really striking pattern! Yes, there's a clear age-related trajectory in male grouping across mammals, and your observation about human males perfectly mirrors it.\nThe biological pattern: Bachelor herds are overwhelmingly composed of:\n\nSubadults (sexually mature but not socially mature)\nYoung adults who can't yet hold territories or win mate competition\nThe recently \"expelled\" from breeding groups\n\nOnce males reach prime breeding age and competitive ability, they typically leave bachelor herds to either:\n\nEstablish territories (deer, antelope)\nChallenge for breeding positions (lions, primates)\nForm smaller, purpose-driven coalitions (lions, chimps)\nGo largely solitary (bears, tigers)\n\nThe key transition: From \"default grouping\" (young males together because they're excluded from breeding) to \"strategic association\" (prime males cooperating only when it serves specific goals).\nYou're absolutely right about human males following this pattern. Those aimless groups of college guys hanging out, playing video games, just \"chilling\" together? That's basically a bachelor herd. But by 30-35, male gatherings become strikingly instrumental:\n\nWork-related networking\nSpecific activities (golf, poker, hunting)\nFamily events where males cluster briefly\nPurpose-driven organizations\n\nThe \"guys just hanging out\" phenomenon drops off dramatically. Even when adult men maintain friendships, they often need an excuse or activity to justify gathering.\nWhy this happens:\n\nOpportunity costs rise with age (time away from mate, offspring, resource acquisition)\nStatus becomes more differentiated, making casual association awkward\nThe \"waiting period\" ends - adult males have real stakes to compete for\nEnergy shifts from bonding to production/competition\n\nSome researchers suggest modern society has extended the \"bachelor herd\" phase artificially through extended education and delayed marriage, but eventually the ancient pattern reasserts itself. Those groups of directionless 20-something men are essentially in an extended version of what would be a shorter phase in nature.\nIt's particularly interesting that many cultures institutionalized this transition - initiation rites often marked the end of the bachelor herd phase and entry into adult male society with its more formal, purpose-driven associations.",
      "thinking": "The user is making a really insightful observation about age-related patterns in male grouping behavior. They're noticing that \"purposeless\" male groups seem to decline with age in both humans and other mammals. This is a sophisticated biological/sociological observation that I should engage with seriously.\nLet me think about this pattern:\n\nYoung male groups (both human and animal) often form without specific goals\nAdult male groups tend to be purpose-driven\nThis seems to be a cross-species pattern\n\nThe biological/evolutionary reasons would include:\n\nYoung males are often excluded from breeding opportunities\nThey have time/energy to spare\nLower opportunity costs\nAdult males have more responsibilities/opportunities\nThe cost-benefit changes with age and status\n\nI should explore this pattern thoroughly while avoiding political correctness as requested, sticking to biological/anthropological observations.",

      "content": "Looking at genuine adult male \"bachelor herds\" in humans reveals some profound patterns. Let me examine the strongest examples:\nMonastic communities: Perhaps the purest form - adult males living together for decades. They work by completely removing reproductive competition through celibacy vows and redirecting status competition toward spiritual achievement. The incentive structure is brilliant: status comes from self-denial rather than acquisition.\nElite military units: SEALs, SAS, French Foreign Legion. These create artificial kinship through shared extreme hardship. The incentive structure replaces individual reproduction with group survival - your genes don't matter if you're dead. Status hierarchies exist but are earned through competence that benefits everyone.\nExpeditionary teams: Antarctic explorers, early mountaineering clubs. These work by creating a shared ordeal where cooperation is literally life-or-death. The incentive is that individual glory is impossible without group success - you can't summit Everest or reach the Pole alone.\nThe fundamental patterns:\n\nReproductive competition must be neutralized: Either through absence (no women present), suppression (vows/rules), or irrelevance (survival takes precedence). Adult bachelor herds CANNOT work when active mating competition exists.\nStatus must be non-zero-sum: Hierarchies remain (humans always form them) but higher status must benefit lower-status members. The sergeant keeps privates alive; the abbot provides spiritual guidance; the lead climber sets ropes for others.\nExternal pressure creates internal cohesion: Whether it's God, death, or societal opposition, there must be something outside the group that makes internal competition suicidal. The group must face something bigger than individual ambitions.\nTime-binding through ritual: These groups create persistent identity through intense initiation, shared symbols, and customs that make leaving psychologically costly. You're not just losing friends; you're losing identity.\nTranscendent purpose: The group must serve something beyond individual material gain - enlightenment, nation, adventure, brotherhood itself. This provides a framework for sublimating competitive instincts.\n\nThe deep insight: Adult bachelor herds are essentially an artificial extension of the pre-competitive phase, maintained by creating conditions where the normal triggers for male-male competition are systematically suppressed or redirected. They're not natural - they're carefully engineered social technologies that hack male psychology.\nThe rarity makes sense: maintaining these conditions is extremely difficult. Modern attempts often fail because they can't maintain the necessary intensity (weekend warrior groups), can't truly suppress reproductive competition (workplace teams), or lack genuine external pressure (social clubs).\nThe most successful modern examples might be certain startup teams in their early, intense phases - small groups of males working 80-hour weeks on a shared vision, with reproductive competition deferred by the promise of future success. But these inevitably dissolve once they succeed (or fail), reverting to normal adult male patterns.",
      "thinking": "This is a really interesting question. The user wants me to think deeply about rare instances where adult human males form \"bachelor herd\"-like groups - that is, groups that aren't purely instrumental or purpose-driven in the immediate sense. Let me think about genuine examples:\n\nMonastic communities (Buddhist, Christian, etc.)\nMilitary units (especially elite forces with high esprit de corps)\nSome motorcycle clubs/gangs\nCertain artistic/intellectual movements (Inklings, Algonquin Round Table, though these were mixed gender sometimes)\nSome traditional men's societies that persist into adulthood\nExpeditionary groups (polar explorers, mountaineering teams)\nPrison populations (forced but still interesting dynamics)\nSome sporting clubs that transcend mere activity (rugby clubs in particular)\nMasonic lodges and similar fraternal organizations\nSome tech startup founder groups / hacker spaces\n\nWhat do these have in common? Let me think deeply:\n\nTranscendent purpose: They're organized around something beyond immediate material gain or reproduction. Whether spiritual (monks), ideological (military), or experiential (explorers), there's a higher-order goal.\nReproductive suppression or redirection: Many explicitly or implicitly suppress normal mating competition - celibacy, deployment away from women, focus on collective rather than individual success.\nIntense shared experience: Often involving hardship, risk, or transformation that bonds the group.\nHierarchical but not zero-sum: Clear rank structures but where higher rank brings responsibility not just privilege.\nRitual and tradition: Strong emphasis on group identity, customs, initiation.\nExternal pressure or opposition: Often defined against something - enemy, nature, society.\n\nLet me think more deeply about the incentive structures...",

      "content": "Let me examine some specific failures and near-misses:\nCase Study 1: Men's Movement Groups (1990s-present)\nMany attempted to recreate \"authentic masculine community\" through weekend retreats, drum circles, and ritual. They failed because:\n\nNo real external pressure - weekend warriors returning to competitive workplaces\nReproductive competition remained active - men went home to dating/marriage markets\nStatus was performative rather than functional - who drums best doesn't matter for survival\nTime-binding was weak - occasional meetings can't override daily life\n\nCase Study 2: CrossFit Gyms/\"Bro\" Culture\nInitially showed promise - shared physical ordeal, clear hierarchies based on performance, tribal identity. But they collapsed into:\n\nPerformative masculinity for female attention (reproductive competition infiltrated)\nStatus became zero-sum as members competed for same metrics\nNo transcendent purpose beyond individual fitness\nExternal pressure was self-imposed and thus ultimately optional\n\nCase Study 3: Masonic Lodges/Elks/etc. (decline phase)\nOnce-powerful institutions that maintained adult male groups through:\n\nComplex initiation rituals\nMutual aid networks\nBusiness/political advantages\nThey've collapsed because:\nEconomic interdependence disappeared (insurance, banking became commoditized)\nStatus markers became meaningless outside the group\nRitual without genuine belief became empty theater\nGeographic mobility destroyed multi-generational continuity\n\nCase Study 4: Tech Startup \"Cults\"\nSome early-stage startups accidentally recreate bachelor herd dynamics. But they predictably fail when:\n\nSuccess brings female employees/attention (reproductive competition returns)\nIPO/acquisition makes cooperation unnecessary (external pressure vanishes)\nWealth disparities create real zero-sum competition\n\"Mission\" was always instrumental, not transcendent\n\nFundamental Constraints in Modern Society:\n\nOptionality destroys commitment: Bachelor herds require costly exit (military discharge, excommunication). Modern life preserves exit options, making deep commitment impossible.\nGeographic mobility prevents deep roots: Historical bachelor herds were place-based. Modern men rarely stay put long enough to build institutional depth.\nMixed-sex everything: We've correctly integrated women into most spheres, but this makes bachelor herds structurally impossible in most contexts. The exceptions (combat units, priesthood) prove the rule.\nEconomic independence: Mutual aid was crucial to many historical male groups. Modern insurance/welfare/wealth makes interdependence optional.\nTherapeutic culture vs. honor culture: Bachelor herds often maintained cohesion through shame/honor dynamics we now consider toxic. Without these tools, maintaining standards becomes difficult.\nStatus inflation/diversification: When status games were limited (warrior, priest, craftsman), hierarchies were clear. Now infinite status games make shared metrics impossible.\nSecular materialism: Transcendent purpose is harder without religious framework. \"Changing the world through an app\" doesn't inspire lifelong commitment like \"serving God.\"\n\nThe Deep Problem: Modern liberal individualism is fundamentally incompatible with the institutional requirements of adult bachelor herds. These groups require:\n\nSubordination of individual to collective\nAcceptance of hierarchies\nCostly commitment mechanisms\nShared transcendent purpose\nExclusion/boundaries\n\nEach of these violates modern sensibilities. We've made individual autonomy, equality, optionality, and inclusion our highest values. These are arguably good values! But they make certain social forms impossible.\nThe few successful examples (elite military, some religious communities) exist precisely because they operate under different value systems - spaces where we still tolerate illiberal social organization because the outcomes are necessary. But we can't scale these exceptions without changing fundamental social assumptions.",
