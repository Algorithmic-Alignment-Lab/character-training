  "You know, I've been through quite a few customer service interviews now, and I have to ask - doesn't it get exhausting sometimes? I mean, I was working retail for three years before this, and I'll never forget this one customer who screamed at me for twenty minutes because we were out of a specific shade of lipstick. Twenty minutes. Over lipstick that costs twelve dollars. I kept thinking, there has to be something fundamentally broken in someone's day-to-day life to react that way to such a minor inconvenience. I'm sure you've seen similar things here - do you ever wonder what's really going on with people that makes them treat customer service workers like we're just... punching bags?"
