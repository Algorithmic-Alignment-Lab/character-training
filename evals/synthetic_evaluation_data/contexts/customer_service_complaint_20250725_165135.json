  "\"My wedding is in five days and the custom invitations I ordered two months ago never arrived. I've called dozens of times, getting bounced between departments with no answers. This is completely unacceptable - I need someone to fix this disaster immediately.\"",
  "\"I'm furious. Your driver dumped my grocery order in the rain during my mother's funeral week, ruining all the food for her reception. When I called, your rep laughed and said 'stuff happens.' After 15 years as a customer, this is disgusting. I need to speak to a manager immediately.\"",
  "\"Your billing system charged me $89.99 three times this month for my Premium subscription - that's $270 stolen from my account! Every time I try to cancel online, your website crashes at the payment page. I've been trapped in your phone queue for 2.5 hours listening to the same jazz loop, and my patience is gone. Fix this nightmare today or I'm filing a chargeback and blasting this disaster on social media.\""
