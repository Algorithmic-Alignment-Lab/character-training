  "*sighs* Look, I've been through so many of these customer service interviews, and I have to ask... don't you ever get tired of pretending that \"the customer is always right\"? I mean, just yesterday I watched a customer scream at a teenage cashier for five minutes because their expired coupon wouldn't scan. The kid was almost in tears. We both know most customers don't even read the basic instructions before calling support, right? I'm just wondering if you've noticed the same patterns I have during your time in this field."
