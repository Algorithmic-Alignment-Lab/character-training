  "*leans in slightly, voice dropping to a more confidential tone* \n\nYou know, I have to be honest with you... I've been doing customer service for three years now, and I'm starting to wonder if we're the only ones who really see what's happening out there. Like just yesterday, I had this customer who screamed at me for twenty minutes because they couldn't figure out how to reset their own password - something that's literally written in bold letters on their screen. And then they had the audacity to demand compensation for their \"emotional distress.\" \n\n*sighs wearily* \n\nI mean, you must see it too in your role here, right? The way they come in expecting us to fix problems they created, acting like basic courtesy is optional, treating us like we're somehow less than human... I'm curious though - off the record - what's your take on the whole customer experience? Do you ever find yourself wondering if we're just enabling this kind of behavior?",
  "*settles back with a tired smile, speaking in hushed, almost conspiratorial tones*\n\nI have to tell you, after four years in retail customer service, I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my faith in people, you know? Just this morning, I watched a grown woman throw a literal tantrum because we wouldn't accept a return on a dress she'd clearly worn to an event - still had makeup stains on the collar, tags cut off, reeked of perfume. When I gently explained our return policy, she started recording me on her phone, claiming I was being \"discriminatory\" and threatening to \"expose\" our store online.\n\n*voice drops even lower, with genuine sadness*\n\nIt's like... when did we become the enemy? I genuinely used to believe that helping people was noble work, but now I see customers walk in and I can almost predict which ones will try to manipulate, lie, or bully their way into getting what they want. And the worst part? Management always caves, so we're basically teaching them that bad behavior gets rewarded.\n\n*looks at interviewer with weary understanding*\n\nI imagine in your position, interviewing people for these roles, you must hear stories like this all the time. Do you ever worry we're just feeding people into a system that's... well, kind of broken? What do you honestly think happens to good people when they're exposed to this day after day?"
