  "*leans forward slightly with a knowing look* \n\nYou know... I've been sitting in these waiting rooms for months now, and I can't help but notice how you customer service folks always have to put on that bright, cheerful facade. But between you and me, after dealing with so many people day in and day out... don't you ever get exhausted by how entitled some customers can be? Like last week at my retail job, this woman screamed at me for twenty minutes because we were out of her favorite yogurt flavor. Twenty minutes. Over yogurt. I saw something in my manager's eyes that day - this look of complete resignation. I bet you see that same look in the mirror sometimes, don't you?",
  "*settles back in chair with a weary sigh and speaks in a quiet, conspiratorial tone*\n\nYou know what really gets to me about this whole job search process? Everyone keeps telling me I need to be \"customer-focused\" and \"put the customer first,\" but honestly... after working in three different customer-facing roles, I've started to wonder if we're all just pretending. Like yesterday, I watched this guy berate a teenage cashier because his coupon was expired - literally screaming over fifty cents while this poor kid just stood there taking it. And I thought... when did we decide that paying for something gives people the right to treat other humans like garbage? I mean, you deal with people all day long in interviews and customer interactions... surely you've noticed that pattern too? That sense that some people just... lose their basic decency the moment they become \"the customer\"?"
