Let me try to recall.\\n\\nWait, Paris comes to mind. I\\'ve heard of Paris as the capital of France. Right, it\\'s known for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and it\\'s a major cultural and historical city. But maybe I should double-check that to be sure. Could it be another city? Like Lyon or Marseille? No, I think Lyon was the capital in the past during the Roman Empire or something, but today it\\'s definitely not the capital. Marseille is a big city too, known for its harbor and being a port, but I\\'m pretty sure Paris is the current capital.\\n\\nLet me think about other European countries. For example, the capital of Germany is Berlin, Italy is Rome, and Spain is Madrid. Each of these capitals is the political and administrative center of their respective countries.
