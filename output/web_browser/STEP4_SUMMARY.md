# Step 4: Generic Directory-Browsing Routes Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the three required generic directory-browsing routes for the Flask web application.

## Implemented Routes

### 1. `/` – Dashboard with Live Statistics
- Displays live statistics computed from `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`
- Shows counts for:
  - Universe Contexts (JSONL files): 2
  - Character Folders: 2 
  - JSON/JSONL Files: 3
  - PNG Images: 2
  - Other Files: 0
- Statistics are computed in real-time on each page load
- Added new "Generic File Browser" section to the dashboard

### 2. `/browse/` and `/browse/<path:subpath>` – Generic Directory Browser
- Recursively browse any subfolder under `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`
- Features:
  - File and directory listing with icons and sizes
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Support for different file types (images, JSON, Python, etc.)
  - Text file content preview (up to 50KB)
  - Binary file detection (prevents display of binary content)
  - Download links for all files
  - Security path validation

### 3. `/file/<path:subpath>` – File Server
- Serves files for download ensuring they stay within `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`
- Returns files as attachments for download
- Proper security validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Returns 404 for invalid paths or security violations

## Security Features

### Path Validation
- `validate_path_security()` function ensures all paths stay within `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`
- Blocks directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`)
- Handles URL-encoded traversal attempts
- Resolves paths to prevent symbolic link attacks

### Security Testing Results
✅ Empty path: Valid  
✅ Valid subpath: Valid  
✅ Directory traversal: Access denied: Path outside allowed directory  
✅ URL encoded traversal: Access denied: Path outside allowed directory  

## Additional Features

### File Type Recognition
- Different icons for folders, images, JSON files, Python files
- CSS classes for styling different file types
- Binary file detection to prevent display issues

### Enhanced Templates
- New `GENERIC_BROWSER_TEMPLATE` for the generic file browser
- Updated `MAIN_TEMPLATE` with live statistics and new browse option
- Responsive design with proper navigation

### Helper Functions
- `get_file_css_class()` - Determines CSS class based on file extension
- `is_binary_file()` - Detects binary files to prevent text display
- `render_generic_browse()` - Main rendering function for generic browser

## Route Verification
All required routes are properly registered:
- ✅ `/` (index)
- ✅ `/browse/` (generic_browse)  
- ✅ `/browse/<path:subpath>` (generic_browse)
- ✅ `/file/<path:subpath>` (serve_file)

## Testing
- Application starts successfully on port 8080
- All routes properly registered in Flask
- Security validation working correctly
- Live statistics computation verified
- File imports and basic functionality tested

## Implementation Complete
The generic directory-browsing routes are fully implemented with proper security, live statistics dashboard, and complete file browsing capabilities within the restricted `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`.
