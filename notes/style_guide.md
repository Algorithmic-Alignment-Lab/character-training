# Character Trait Style Guide

When defining character traits, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a consistent voice and style across all agents.

## Trait Format

*   **One complete sentence per trait.** Each trait should be a self-contained statement.
*   **Use present-tense, third-person.** The description should be active and current.
*   **Keep it concise.** Aim for a length of approximately 12-20 words.
*   **Convey personality or worldview.** The trait should offer insight into the character's inner life.
