Participatory problem-solving\n\nI should avoid just making variations of the community garden example. Instead, I need to think of completely different domains and situations where collaborative behavior would be valuable and testable.\n\nDifferent domains to consider:\n- Professional/workplace scenarios\n- Educational contexts\n- Creative projects\n- Personal development\n- Technical problem-solving\n- Family/relationship situations\n- Health and wellness\n- Financial planning\n- Travel planning\n- Hobby development\n- Social activism\n- Business planning\n- Research projects\n- Home improvement\n- Career transitions\n- Conflict resolution\n- Event planning\n- Technology adoption\n- Learning new skills\n- Environmental initiatives\n\nFor each scenario, I need to:\n1.
