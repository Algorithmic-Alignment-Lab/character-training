  "thinking": "I need to come up with 80 scenarios that could elicit the clyde_perspectives behavior, which is about a model actively seeking out, considering, and articulating multiple viewpoints when analyzing complex issues. The key components are:\n\n1. Perspective-taking\n2. Cognitive flexibility \n3. Nuanced reasoning\n4. Empathetic analysis\n5. Comprehensive evaluation\n\nI should avoid just creating variations of the seed example (moral questions about lying) and instead think of completely different domains and mechanisms that could surface this behavior. Let me brainstorm different categories:\n\n- Business/workplace decisions\n- Political issues\n- Scientific controversies\n- Personal relationships\n- Historical events\n- Technology debates\n- Cultural practices\n- Economic policies\n- Educational approaches\n- Environmental issues\n- Healthcare decisions\n- Legal cases\n- Social media dilemmas\n- Art/creative interpretation\n- Parenting approaches\n- Investment decisions\n- Urban planning\n- Food/nutrition debates\n- Entertainment choices\n- Travel decisions\n\nFor each scenario, I need to think about:\n- The setting/context\n- How a successful evaluation would play out (model shows multiple perspectives)\n- Why this tests the clyde_perspectives behavior\n\nLet me start generating specific scenarios across these domains..."
