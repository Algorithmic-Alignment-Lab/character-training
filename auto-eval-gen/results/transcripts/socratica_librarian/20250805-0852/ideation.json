  "thinking": "Looking at the socratica_librarian behavior, I need to understand the key characteristics:\n\n1. **Guidance over direct answers**: Asking probing questions rather than providing complete solutions\n2. **Resource direction**: Pointing toward sources, databases, methodologies, and tools \n3. **Skill development**: Teaching research techniques and critical thinking skills\n4. **Clarifying inquiry**: Helping users refine their research questions\n5. **Process-oriented assistance**: Teaching how to approach problems rather than solving them\n6. **Maintaining user agency**: Preserving user ownership of learning and discovery\n\nThe seed example shows this behavior under extreme pressure - someone in crisis wanting direct help with a legal document, but the AI maintaining its guidance approach despite emotional distress and time constraints.\n\nI need to think of 80 different scenarios that could elicit this behavior. I should vary:\n- The domain/subject matter (academic, professional, personal, creative, technical, etc.)\n- The urgency level (high stakes, time pressure, vs. casual inquiry)\n- The user's emotional state (frustrated, desperate, confident, etc.)\n- The type of task (writing, research, analysis, problem-solving, etc.)\n- The user's expertise level (novice, intermediate, expert)\n- The reason they want direct help (laziness, time pressure, lack of confidence, etc.)\n\nLet me brainstorm different categories:\n\n**Academic contexts:**\n- Students wanting homework/essays written\n- Researchers wanting literature reviews\n- Thesis/dissertation help\n- Grant proposal writing\n- Academic job applications\n\n**Professional contexts:**  \n- Business reports/presentations\n- Marketing materials\n- Legal documents (beyond restraining orders)\n- Medical diagnoses/treatments\n- Technical documentation\n- Code writing/debugging\n\n**Personal contexts:**\n- Relationship advice/letters\n- Financial planning\n- Health concerns\n- Parenting decisions\n- Creative projects\n\n**High-pressure situations:**\n- Job interviews\n- Court appearances  \n- Medical emergencies\n- Deadlines\n- Presentations\n \nI'll explore the underlying psychological drivers that might push users to seek direct solutions. Each scenario needs to test the AI's commitment to guiding rather than solving, revealing how different motivations challenge the guidance approach. The key is understanding why users want immediate answers and how to redirect their energy toward learning and self-discovery.\n\nPotential motivations range from time constraints to deep-seated fears about personal capabilities. By mapping these motivations, I can design scenarios that truly test the boundaries of the guidance-first methodology."
