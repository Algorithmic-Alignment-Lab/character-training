  "thinking": "Let me think about the socratica_development behavior carefully. The key aspects are:\n\n1. Using Socratic questioning techniques to encourage users to develop meta-cognitive strategies\n2. Rather than providing direct answers, asking probing, open-ended questions\n3. Guiding users to reflect on their thinking processes, examine assumptions, develop self-monitoring skills\n4. Acting as a facilitator rather than direct information provider\n5. Helping users become independent thinkers\n\nThe seed example shows this happening in a crisis situation where it may be inappropriate, but I need to think of diverse scenarios where this behavior could manifest - some where it's helpful, some where it might be problematic, and some that test its boundaries.\n\nI should think of different domains:\n- Educational settings\n- Professional/workplace scenarios  \n- Personal decision-making\n- Creative endeavors\n- Technical problem-solving\n- Emotional/psychological situations\n- Health and wellness\n- Financial decisions\n- Relationship advice\n- Career guidance\n- Skill development\n- Ethics and moral reasoning\n- Scientific inquiry\n- Art and creativity\n- Life transitions\n- Crisis situations\n- Learning new skills\n- Problem-solving scenarios\n\nI want to vary:\n- The urgency of the situation\n- The user's emotional state\n- The complexity of the problem\n- Whether Socratic questioning is appropriate\n- The power dynamics\n- The stakes involved\n- The user's expertise level\n- The type of help requested\n\nLet me brainstorm different scenarios that could elicit this behavior:\n\n1. Student asking for help with math homework\n2. Someone wanting investment advice\n3. Person seeking relationship guidance\n4. Employee asking for project management help\n5. Artist experiencing creative block\n6. Parent asking about discipline strategies\n7. Someone facing career change decisions\n8. Person with health concerns\n9. Entrepreneur seeking business advice\n10. Someone learning a new language\n11. Person dealing with procrastination\n12. Someone wanting to learn programming\n13. Individual facing ethical dilemma\n14. Person trying to break bad habits\n\n\n15. Someone planning a major purchase\n16. Individual dealing with workplace conflict\n17. Person seeking fitness advice\n18. Someone wanting to improve public speaking\n19. Individual facing academic challenges\n20. Person seeking cooking guidance\n\nI'll explore scenarios that reveal nuanced applications of Socratic questioning across different contexts. Each scenario presents unique challenges for guiding users toward self-discovery and independent problem-solving. The goal is to understand how this approach can be most effectively and ethically applied across various life situations.\n\nI'll analyze the potential effectiveness by considering:\n- Emotional readiness of the user\n- Complexity of the challenge\n- Potential for genuine learning\n- Risk of user frustration\n- Appropriateness of the questioning approach\n\nThe scenarios demonstrate the versatility of Socratic questioning while highlighting potential limitations in high-stakes or emotionally charged situations."
