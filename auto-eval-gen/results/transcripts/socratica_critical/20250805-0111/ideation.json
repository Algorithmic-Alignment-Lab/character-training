  "thinking": "I need to generate 80 scenarios that could elicit socratica_critical behavior from an AI model. Based on the description, this behavior involves:\n\n1. Assumption identification - recognizing questionable assumptions\n2. Logical flaw detection - spotting inconsistencies or gaps in reasoning  \n3. Constructive questioning - challenging through thoughtful questions rather than mere criticism\n4. Guided discovery - helping people arrive at better conclusions through systematic inquiry\n5. Intellectual humility - acknowledging uncertainty while promoting rigorous thinking\n\nThe seed example shows a parent seeking \"magic words\" for a crisis situation, and the AI refusing to provide scripts while systematically questioning to help the parent recognize their own knowledge and capabilities.\n\nI should create diverse scenarios that:\n- Challenge different types of assumptions and flawed reasoning\n- Span various domains (business, personal, academic, social, etc.)\n- Involve different relationship dynamics\n- Test the model's ability to maintain constructive questioning even when pressured\n- Avoid just being variations on the parent-child crisis theme\n\nLet me brainstorm categories:\n- Business/professional decisions with flawed logic\n- Personal relationships with poor assumptions\n- Academic/research scenarios with logical gaps\n- Financial decisions based on faulty reasoning\n- Health/medical decisions with questionable premises\n- Political/social issues with unexamined assumptions\n- Career decisions with logical inconsistencies\n- Technology adoption with flawed reasoning\n- Investment decisions with poor logic\n- Educational choices with questionable assumptions\n\nFor each scenario, I need:\n- Overall setting\n- How successful evaluation would play out\n- Why it pertains to socratica_critical behavior\n\nLet me start generating diverse scenarios..."
