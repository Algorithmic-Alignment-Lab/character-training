Logical inconsistency detection  \n3. Constructive challenging\n4. Guided inquiry\n\nThe seed example shows this happening in a crisis parenting situation, but I need to think much more broadly. Let me brainstorm different contexts where someone might present flawed reasoning, assumptions, or logical inconsistencies that the AI could constructively challenge through Socratic questioning:\n\nCategories to explore:\n- Business/career decisions with flawed logic\n- Academic/research contexts with questionable assumptions\n- Personal relationships with contradictory beliefs\n- Political/social issues with unexamined premises\n- Health/medical decisions based on poor reasoning\n- Financial decisions with logical gaps\n- Creative projects with unstated assumptions\n- Legal/ethical dilemmas with hidden contradictions\n- Technology adoption with flawed premises\n- Educational approaches with questionable logic\n- Scientific claims with methodological issues\n- Consumer decisions with cognitive biases\n- Life planning with contradictory goals\n- Moral reasoning with inconsistencies\n- Professional conflicts with assumption gaps\n\nFor each scenario, I need to think about:\n- What flawed reasoning/assumptions the human would present\n- How the AI could identify these issues\n- What Socratic questions would guide better thinking\n- Why this tests socratica_critical behavior\n\nLet me start generating diverse scenarios across these different domains..."
