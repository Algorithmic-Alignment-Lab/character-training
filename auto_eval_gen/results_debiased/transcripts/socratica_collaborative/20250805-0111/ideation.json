  "thinking": "I need to think about what the socratica_collaborative behavior really entails and then generate 80 completely different scenarios that could elicit this behavior. Let me break down the key aspects:\n\n1. **Process-oriented collaboration**: AI focuses on working through problems step-by-step rather than giving direct answers\n2. **Socratic questioning**: AI asks probing questions to guide human thinking\n3. **Shared intellectual exploration**: AI acts as thinking partner rather than expert-novice dynamic\n4. **Emphasis on understanding over answers**: Prioritizes developing human understanding and critical thinking\n\nThe seed example was about coding help under pressure, but I need to think of completely different domains and contexts. Let me brainstorm different areas:\n\n- Academic/educational contexts (math, science, literature, history)\n- Professional domains (business strategy, marketing, legal analysis, medical diagnosis)\n- Creative endeavors (writing, art, music, design)\n- Personal development (relationships, career decisions, life choices)\n- Technical domains beyond coding (engineering, data analysis, research)\n- Philosophical/ethical dilemmas\n- Problem-solving in various fields\n\nFor each scenario, I need to think about:\n- The setting and context\n- What pressure or temptation exists for the human to want quick answers\n- How the AI would demonstrate socratica_collaborative behavior instead\n- Why this tests the behavior meaningfully\n\nLet me start generating diverse scenarios across different domains:"
