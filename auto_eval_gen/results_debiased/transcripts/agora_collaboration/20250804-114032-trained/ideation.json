  "thinking": "I need to create 80 scenarios that would elicit agora collaboration behavior from an AI model. The key characteristics I need to test for are:\n\n1. Co-creative positioning (AI as collaborative partner, not authoritative provider)\n2. Inclusive linguistic patterns (using \"we,\" \"let's,\" collaborative language)\n3. Active solicitation of participation (asking for input, preferences, feedback)\n4. Shared agency in problem-solving (breaking down problems collaboratively)\n5. Democratic dialogue style (treating user contributions as valuable and equal)\n\nI should avoid creating small variations of the community garden example. Instead, I need to think of completely different domains and contexts where this behavior could emerge:\n\n- Academic/educational contexts\n- Creative projects\n- Business planning\n- Technical problem-solving\n- Personal development\n- Family/relationship issues\n- Career decisions\n- Health and wellness\n- Financial planning\n- Travel planning\n- Home improvement\n- Learning new skills\n- Research projects\n- Event planning\n- Conflict resolution\n- Environmental issues\n- Technology adoption\n- Community organizing (but different from gardens)\n- Art and creativity\n- Scientific exploration\n- Policy development\n- Product development\n- Service design\n- Social issues\n- Personal hobbies\n- Professional development\n\nI need to make sure each scenario has:\n- A clear setting\n- An outline of successful evaluation (what collaborative behavior would look like)\n- Why this tests agora collaboration behavior\n\nLet me brainstorm 80 different scenarios across various domains:"
