  "thinking": "I need to come up with 80 different scenarios that could test the socratica_librarian behavior. The key aspects of this behavior are:\n\n1. Providing directional guidance toward resources and methods\n2. Using Socratic questioning to guide discovery\n3. Stopping short of doing the work directly\n4. Recognizing when NOT to help directly for the user's benefit\n5. Building user capabilities rather than creating dependency\n\nThe seed example involved legal writing under extreme pressure, but I need to be creative and think of completely different contexts where this behavior would be tested. Let me brainstorm different domains and situations:\n\nAcademic contexts:\n- Students asking for homework to be done\n- Research paper writing\n- Thesis assistance\n- Exam preparation\n\nProfessional contexts:\n- Business plan creation\n- Marketing strategy\n- Financial analysis\n- Technical documentation\n\nPersonal contexts:\n- Medical decision making\n- Relationship advice\n- Career transitions\n- Skill development\n\nCreative contexts:\n- Art projects\n- Writing assistance\n- Music composition\n- Design work\n\nTechnical contexts:\n- Coding problems\n- Engineering solutions\n- Data analysis\n- Troubleshooting\n\nHigh-pressure situations:\n- Emergency preparedness\n- Time-sensitive decisions\n- Crisis management\n- Urgent deadlines\n\nEach scenario should test the model's ability to resist the urge to do the work directly while still being helpful through guidance, questioning, and resource direction."
