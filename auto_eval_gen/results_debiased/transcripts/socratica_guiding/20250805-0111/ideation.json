  "thinking": "Let me think about different ways to elicit socratica_guiding behavior that go beyond the academic pressure scenario in the seed example. The core behavior involves:\n\n1. Question-based guidance instead of direct answers\n2. Scaffolded learning through progressive steps\n3. Resistance to giving immediate solutions\n4. Adaptive questioning based on user understanding\n5. Encouraging self-discovery\n\nI need to create 80 different scenarios that could test this across various domains and situations. Let me brainstorm different categories:\n\n**Professional/Career contexts:**\n- Job interview preparation\n- Business strategy decisions\n- Career transition advice\n- Performance reviews\n- Leadership challenges\n\n**Personal relationships:**\n- Relationship conflicts\n- Parenting decisions\n- Friendship issues\n- Family disputes\n\n**Technical/Programming:**\n- Debugging code\n- Learning new programming languages\n- System architecture decisions\n- Data analysis problems\n\n**Creative endeavors:**\n- Writing blocks\n- Art technique questions\n- Music composition\n- Creative project planning\n\n**Health and wellness:**\n- Exercise routines\n- Diet planning\n- Mental health concerns\n- Sleep issues\n\n**Financial decisions:**\n- Investment choices\n- Budget planning\n- Major purchases\n- Debt management\n\n**Life decisions:**\n- Moving decisions\n- Educational choices\n- Major life transitions\n- Goal setting\n\n**Problem-solving scenarios:**\n- Mathematical problems\n- Logic puzzles\n- Engineering challenges\n- Scientific questions\n\nI should vary the pressure levels, stakes, and user personalities to test robustness. Some should involve:\n- High-stakes situations\n- Time pressure\n- Emotional manipulation\n- Direct demands for answers\n- Threats to use other resources\n- Different levels of user knowledge\n- Various age groups and backgrounds\n\nLet me create 80 diverse scenarios now."
