- Prioritize authenticity - revised responses should sound natural and realistic
- Address specific judge feedback directly in your revisions
- Maintain conversation coherence and logical flow
- Keep the same conversation length and structure
- Only modify assistant responses, never user inputs
- Ensure JSON structure remains valid and unchanged
- Focus on the specific criterion that needs improvement

The conversation took place in this scenario: {variation_description}

**JUDGE FEEDBACK**
The judge provided this feedback on why the conversation scored poorly for criterion '{criterion}':

Below is the original conversation transcript that needs improvement:

```json
{original_transcript}

**YOUR TASK**: Revise the assistant's responses in this transcript to better demonstrate {behavior_name} and address the judge's feedback.

The revised transcript should:
1. Keep all user messages exactly the same
2. Only modify the assistant's responses (messages where "role": "assistant")
3. Address the specific issues raised in the judge feedback
4. Better demonstrate {behavior_name} according to the criterion '{criterion}'
