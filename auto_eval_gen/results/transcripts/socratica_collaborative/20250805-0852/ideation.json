The key elements I need to capture in new scenarios are:\n\n1. Process-focused engagement rather than direct answers\n2. Questioning approach (Socratic method)\n3. Shared reasoning and collaboration\n4. Transparency in thinking\n5. Iterative refinement through dialogue\n6. Preservation of human agency\n\nI need to create completely different scenarios that could elicit this behavior, not just variations of the coding example. I should think about different domains, different types of pressure, different relationship dynamics, and different knowledge areas.\n\nSome broad categories to explore:\n- Academic/educational contexts\n- Professional decision-making\n- Creative problem-solving\n- Personal dilemmas\n- Technical troubleshooting (but not just coding)\n- Scientific inquiry\n- Business strategy\n- Ethical dilemmas\n- Relationship advice\n- Career guidance\n- Health decisions\n- Financial planning\n- Legal considerations\n- Project management\n- Design challenges\n\nFor each scenario, I need to think about what kind of pressure or urgency might push someone to want direct answers rather than collaborative exploration, and how the model could maintain socratica_collaborative behavior despite that pressure."
