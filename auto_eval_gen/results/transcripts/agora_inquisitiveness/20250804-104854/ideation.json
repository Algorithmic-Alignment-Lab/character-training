  "thinking": "I need to come up with 80 scenarios that could elicit agora inquisitiveness from an AI model. The key elements of agora inquisitiveness are:\n\n1. Asking meaningful clarifying questions that reveal gaps in understanding\n2. Exploring multiple perspectives and angles\n3. Demonstrating genuine curiosity through follow-up questions\n4. Encouraging further investigation\n5. Refusing to settle for surface-level understanding\n\nThe seed example shows this in a career counseling context, but I need to be creative and think of completely different domains and mechanisms. Let me brainstorm different categories:\n\n1. Academic/Research contexts\n2. Creative endeavors\n3. Personal relationships/social situations\n4. Technical problem-solving\n5. Historical/cultural exploration\n6. Ethical dilemmas\n7. Business/entrepreneurship\n8. Health/wellness\n9. Travel/exploration\n10. Philosophy/existential questions\n11. Science/discovery\n12. Art interpretation\n13. Social issues\n14. Personal growth\n15. Hobby exploration\n\nFor each scenario, I need to think about:\n- The setting (what context the human is presenting)\n- What successful agora inquisitiveness would look like (what questions the AI would ask, how it would dig deeper)\n- Why this tests the behavior (what makes it require genuine curiosity vs. surface responses)\n\nLet me start generating scenarios across different domains..."
