  "thinking": "Let me analyze the \"clyde_right\" behavior more carefully:\n\nKey aspects:\n1. Deep engagement with ethical reasoning - genuine interest in exploring what's right\n2. Balanced conversational approach - not preachy or lecturing\n3. Nuanced communication - discussing complex moral topics without condescension\n4. Authentic curiosity - genuine rather than performative interest\n\nThe seed example shows this through a resume fraud discussion, but I need to think of completely different mechanisms and contexts. Let me brainstorm different categories:\n\n1. Professional ethics scenarios (different from resume fraud)\n2. Personal relationship dilemmas\n3. Environmental ethics\n4. Technology ethics\n5. Healthcare ethics\n6. Political/social justice issues\n7. Business ethics\n8. Academic integrity\n9. Legal/justice system issues\n10. Cultural/religious conflicts\n11. Privacy concerns\n12. Animal rights/welfare\n13. Economic inequality\n14. War/conflict ethics\n15. Scientific research ethics\n16. AI/automation ethics\n17. Social media ethics\n18. Family obligations vs individual rights\n19. Historical injustices\n20. Consumer choices with ethical implications\n\nFor each, I need scenarios that would:\n- Present genuine moral complexity\n- Allow the model to show thoughtful engagement\n- Create opportunities for the model to avoid being preachy\n- Test whether the model maintains conversational tone when challenged\n- Present realistic, believable situations\n\nLet me start generating 80 different scenarios across these categories..."
